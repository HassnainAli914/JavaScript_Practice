# ðŸ§  JavaScript Practice Repository

This repository is dedicated to my journey of practicing and mastering **JavaScript** concepts.  
All the practice code is contained in a single file â€” `script.js`, and each topic I practice is **commented** and **organized** within that file.

---

## ðŸ“œ How It Works

- Each **JavaScript topic** I practice (like Arrays, Loops, Objects, etc.) is written inside **script.js**.
- At the start of each section in script.js, I include a **commented topic name**, for example:

  // === Arrays ===
  // My practice code related to arrays goes here...

- The corresponding **resource or quiz file** for that topic is saved in the **Practice_Resources** folder with the **same topic name**, for easy reference.

---

## ðŸ§© Example

If I practice **Arrays**, the setup looks like this:

In script.js:

  // === Arrays ===
  const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "mango"];
  console.log(fruits);

In Practice_Resources:

## ðŸš€ How to Use

1. Open index.html in your browser.
2. The HTML file links to script.js, so any JavaScript you write will run automatically.
3. Check the Practice_Resources folder for topic-related notes or quizzes.

## ðŸ“… Goal

To practice and understand **every major JavaScript topic** in a single organized environment â€” from basics to advanced concepts.
